Belly Button Biodiversity - Building a Dashboard
This challenge involves building an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset provided in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
